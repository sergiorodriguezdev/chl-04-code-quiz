# Challenge 04 - Code Quiz

## Project Description

This Code Quiz will test the user's knowledge of JavaScript. It's a fun way for the end user to test their JavaScript knowledge when preparing for an interview. This is a timed quiz and the scores are saved for the user to beat their best score. Wrong answers will result in a 10 second penalty!

I had the opportunity to apply some more advanced concepts I have learned so far such as dynamically updating the DOM and using the browser's local storage to store/retrieve values. I also learned some additional methods available in JavaScript such as `Array.sort()` and how it is used to create a custom sort algorithm for the datatype stored in the array, as well as `Array.forEach()` to use as an alternative to `for` loops to iterate through a given array.

I still struggled with committing my code frequently on this project initially. However, I am getting used to enforcing a milestone system where I commit my code when I think I have reached a milestone whether it's a major or minor one. I also had the opportunity to apply some concepts that are not my strongest such as `flexbox` and CSS in general, but I feel like I'm slowly getting the hang of them!
